        f"Important: When the negative prompt is contradicted with positive prompt or quality following the negative prompt should not be a reason to decrease score for the positive and quality score. (such as negative prompt being 'car' while positive being 'New York street', showing no cars should not be a reason to decrease score for positive, even though it does not look like a New York street anymore. Similar goes for removing an important part of an item, like a car but with negative prompt of wheels, removing wheels making it less of a car, however, when you rate it, you should NOT decrease the score based on this) "
